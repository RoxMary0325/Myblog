    <p class="descript">Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon), and formally 日本国 is an island country in East Asia. It is in the northwest Pacific Ocean and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 14,125 islands, with the five main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.
        Japan has over 125 million inhabitants and is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its highly urbanized population on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Japan has the world's highest life expectancy, although it is experiencing a population decline due to its very low birth rate.

    <p class="descript">Ice cream may be universally appealing, but many countries have their own version, according to Jeni Britton Bauer, founder of the ice cream brand Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams and the author of two books on the subject.

        “Every culture has a different interpretation of ice cream that’s often not called ice cream, and it’s a food that brings people together,” she says. “You gather at your local ice cream store or at an ice cream cart on the street.”</p>
